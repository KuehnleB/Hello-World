# Hello-World
Test- and learning-enviroment for PHYTHON projects

I'm new to programming and coding and try to learn it. I'm gonna start with python. For sure, i will not be able to make any serious contributions to professional projects. More or less, my repository is just for fun and for learning an testing my knowledge.
